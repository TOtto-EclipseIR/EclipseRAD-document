## Structure

The root of a particular document may start at the Set & Volume, Book & Chapter, Collection & Article, or other hierarchy level.

### Set & Volume

A *Set* is a collection of *Volumes* which may be divided alphabetically, by Topic and Sub-topic, etc. Think of it as an old-fashioned encyclopedia. 

### Book & Chapter

A *Book* typically is a collection of *Chapters* (or *Prefaces*, *Appendices*, etc.) on a certain topic.

### Collection & Article

A *Collection* is a set of somewhat related *Articles*, that stand alone rather than being part of a book. Technical notes are a good example of an article.
